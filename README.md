# Gulp Devtools for Firefox

A port of the chrome gulp extension to Firefox. Requires Firefox 34.

Note: this is super basic but seems to work, all I really did was check out [the chrome extension](https://github.com/niki4810/gulp-devtools) and then cp -r from the [chrome_extension](https://github.com/niki4810/gulp-devtools/tree/master/chrome-extension) folder into this add-on's data folder. And it just works.
